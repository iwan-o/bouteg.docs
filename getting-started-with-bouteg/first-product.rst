Premier produit
===============

We move to one of the most important sections of the Admin panel - products management. As you can see, the **Catalog**
section in the menu is quite extended, but we will, for now, focus on product creation only.

You can pick a *simple* or *configurable* product type before its creation. Making long story short -
*simple* is a product that has just one version,
*configurable* is a product where the customer gets to choose some options of it (like size or colour).
Check out the Products chapter in for more information.
